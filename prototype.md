# Prototype #
The purpose for prototyping is to demonstrate each team members design for their respective block diagram. During this phase, each team member must demonstrate that their part worked independently by measuring input and output.
A more detailed outline of prototyping can be found [here](http://ecen4013.okstate.edu/pages/project2/prototype.htm)

Prototyping phase is split up to each individual by their block diagram.
Seal Tome also began working on the packaging for the final product in this stage.  Below are a few pictures of the process:

# Chapter 2: Prototype #
The Senior council was independent of any kingdom, and operated on its own agenda. With the Titans of Arcane, the council enforced its rulings over the balance of magic. After the events of Research Presentation, and the victory of Sealtome VI over the titans, the council began to loose their authority over the other kingdoms. In a attempt to maintain the status quot, the council sent two more titans to stop Sealteam VI, James the Mill Titan, and Aron the Solder Titan.

After our Heroes victory over the titans, they now face a bigger challenge. The Great Silicon Library has now been consumed by the plague, and our heroes must flee across the lands to their next destination, the rich caves of the Golden Kingdom.

After many weeks in the rich caves of the Golden Kingdom, the Titans caught up to Sealtome VI. As Sealtome VI started to gain grounds against the Titans, a third titan showed up, Anuj the Pic Titan. Now, losing ground the team resorted to their last strategy. After a hour and a half, both parties grew hungry and called it a draw.

This battle came to be know as Prototyping Presentation. After our Heroes victory, they prepare themselves for the next phase of their journey, integration.
