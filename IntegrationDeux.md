# Introduction #

This is where it all comes together.  Below you may see the fruits of Seal Tome VI's labor.  The Sorcerer's Spelltome turned out to be a success.  The team was told that it was an exemplary item in the hall of engineering design projects relative to the MAGE system.

The overall current draw turned out to be something spectacular.  The tome was measured to consume no more than 350mA of current.  Therefore the Lithium Ion battery found within the cell-phone charger system made by Anker turned out to be a bit overkill...that is unless one plans to play a MAGE game for a day and a half straight.

The plexi-glass imaging device found on the cover of the tome utilizes a total internal reflection property of transparent materials that have light shown into them.  The etched portions of the acrylic/plexi allow a reflected amount of light to "show-up" by being given a reflective path out of the transparent material.  This reflective path allows the incident light to leave the sheet of transparent material once the rays strike the etched areas.  Otherwise, the light tends to stay within the material unless striking an edge that lies within the normal or near normal incidence path of the transmitted light.   This creates the extremely vivid optical effects which affects the eyes and the mind in a positive way.  Similar technologies may be found utilizing IR reflected light within multi-touch "surface" computers.  A camera that is sensitive to the IR spectrum is used as a computer vision control mechanism once a portion of the control "surface" is pressed.  A fingerprint allows a reflective exit path for the internally reflected light shone inside the sheets of acrylic or Plexiglas used within these systems.  This gave Seal Tome VI the idea for the front cover imaging device.

The original idea was to utilize the edges of the device to distribute the 360 degree IR MIRP packets.  This technique of shining the IR transmitters into the Plexiglas was never tested.  It would have been an interesting portion of the project had the device actually transmitted the data into the Plexiglas and out of the edges without any sort of data degradation of the sent signal.

The following two pictures allow one to see the functionality of the page turning.  Noticing the holes at the top right hand corner of the page allows the viewer to get a glimpse into the control system of the Spelltome.  Each page has a different number of holes cut out of it in this area.  As each page is turned, a particular combination is created that corresponds to a particular spell.  Thus a spell may be cast.

The health meter may be seen in the upper left side of the page.  As the tome is damaged or healed, the meter changes to indicate life status.

The above picture shows the "fast" cool-down jumper.  This mode shows the fast selection to allow a fast 10 second cool-down.  By switching the jumper to the optional two pin pair, a longer cool-down is implemented.

The picture above shows the connection made between the two RGB LED drivers.  The 1st RGB driver powers the health meter's LEDs.  The 2nd, shown above, powers the LEDs found in the plexi-glass covering.

Above are some of the power jumpers used as a safety device within the tome. The jumpers and leads, once disconnected, take power away from the control circuitry.  The mini-usb plug and jack may be seen as well.  This point is fed from the regulator and Lithium Ion battery system.

Above is a photo of the photo-transistor board that allows the tome to be controlled by turning the pages of the device.  By allowing a particular group to have light shown on them, the switching occurs so that the microprocessor's interrupts may be fired.  This causes a particular spell to be chosen and thus sent out into the MAGE world!

This last picture shows the main control board for the Sorcerer's Spelltome.  It includes many components of the system.
