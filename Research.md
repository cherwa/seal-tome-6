# Research #

Each team member should verify their design is valid, and can be build. This involved gathering information, devising multiple approaches, and decision making based on research. At a minimum we needed:
  * Research different possible approaches to our design
  * Come up with at lest two alternative approaches
  * Collect magical information, such as datasheets, application notes, and schematics
  * If possible, show simulations of individual block diagram

A more detailed outline of research can be found [here!](http://ecen4013.okstate.edu/pages/project2/research.htm)

The Research was split up by:
| Team Member | Research Topic | Description |
|:------------|:---------------|:------------|
| Jason Norton | Power          | Responsible for delivering the correct amount of power to the spelltome |
| Cherwa Vang | Micro-controller | Responsible for the construction the micro-controller along with programming the main loop |
| Nik Marinov | Audio          | Responsible for all auditory outputs from the spelltome |
| Ryan Syrus  | Communications | Responsible for IR communication, as well as Xbee |
| Michael Oltmanns | Visuals        | Responsible for all visual outputs form the spelltome |
| Jessie Monterroso | Page Mechanic/Packaging | Responsible for the spell selection mechanic, and the packing for the spelltome |



# Chapter 1: Research #

After the Spelltome was destroyed at the end of the Third Age, a mediator group arose and dedicated themselves to the balance and preservation of magic among the land of Ronies Ngised. This group came to be known as the Senior Council. To enforce their rulings the council created the Titans of Arcane (TA). It was the Senior Council's decision to destroy the spelltome, and maintain balance. Our heroes must get pass the TA's and the council in order to construct the spelltome

Many milestones lie ahead for our heroes. The first of many was researching. In order to reconstruct the spelltome our heroes needed to know about the origins of the spelltome, how it worked, where it came from, and how it came to be. Our heroes spent many weeks in the Great Silicon Library trying to solve this mystery, but time was not on their side.

When news of the reconstruction of the spelltome came to the council, strict enforcement was in place against the reconstruction. The council sent the PIC Titan Anuj, and the Titan Prime Vignesh, to stop Sealtome VI.

After many weeks of researching the team was confronted by the two Titans. It was soon realized that a peaceful resolution could not be drawn between both parties, and conflict soon followed. This battle came to be known as Research Presentation. After a grueling two hours of fighting, the two parties grew hungry, and concluded to a draw.

Now with research out of the way the team readies themselves for their next milestone, Prototyping.
