# Prologue: Introduction #

Long, long ago, in the First Age of the land of Ngised Ronies, Dwarves, Elves, and Man lived in a constant state of war and confusion. The land was divided into hundreds of individual city states. Neither city state cared for his neighbor, nor his kind.

It wasn't until the Etheons created Kingdom of Silicon that ended the violence, marking the start of the Second Age. No one knew where the Etheons came from, or what they were, some speculate they were the gods themselves.

The Kingdom of Silicon was a Utopia, a place of wisdom and knowledge. From this peace, three other great Kingdom emerged: The Dwarven Kingdom of Gold, The Elven Kingdom of Silver, and The Iron Kingdom of Man.

But, in their infinite wisdom, the Etheons left our world, taking with them their Utopia, and the peace. What was once a kingdom filed with life and joy, is now filled with emptiness and void. But the Etheons didn't take everything with them. Left behind in The Great Silicon Libary, was the Spelltome.

The Spelltome was a book that has inside it the record of all magic spells ever created. It had the ability to perfectly replicate any spell within its bindings. Such a powerful book attracted the attention of the three remaining great kingdoms.

And once again, the land of Ngised Ronies was at war, marking the end of the Second Age, and starting the Third Age, the age of war. After a century of war between the Three Kingdoms, they came to an agreement. In order to bring peace to the lands, the Three Kingdoms agreed to destroy the Spelltome.

This put an end to the war, and brought peace back to the land of Ngised Ronies, starting the Fourth Age. But this peace didn't last for long. Shortly after the Spelltome was destroyed, a darkness rose over the land. Soon reports of children being consumed by the shadows started to show up. Followed by cities, then districts.

These shadows were soon identified as an ancient enemy of the Etheons, know as the Plague. Soon it was discovered that the Spelltome was not a book of spells, but a ward against the Plague.

Now the Three Kingdoms must unite to defeat the darkness. Each kingdom choose two of the greatest Magic Engineers. These 6 engineers formed the team known as Sealtome VI. Their job, is to reconstruct the Spelltome.
