#summary Seal\_Tome\_6\_Integration.

# Introduction #
Introduction Phase 1 is the next step to completing the entire system.  Each team is to ultimately get each of their components working together as an entire unit.  Many teams have fallen shy of this task as it seems to be the most difficult of each stage.  Many components will work well, alone.  Once they are integrated into the system, mayhem ensues for the components that have not been carefully designed.  Close communication with other teammates is apparent once this stage has been completed.  The teams that have worked well with one another and whom have kept a close eye on the design goals at hand, show a competed system integration phase without breaking a bead of sweat on their brow.  The teams that have not worked as a tight unit on the design tasks presented before them fall short of the tasks requested of them.

Seal Tome 6 has not broken a bead of sweat.  The team completed the phase flawlessly...well, minus one slight hang-up on presentation day.  It seems that someone decided to rearrange the system wiring to keep from incorporating a bread board.  While rearranging the wires, a lead on the power supply block snapped and an emergency response team was brought in to revive the power block.

All was well once they had a completed power block.  As an entire system, the Spelltome was measured to consume around 350mA of current.  This is completely different than what was suspected before.

## Details ##
Below are some pictures from the Integration Phase 1 system components.

The Xbee board and the BJT board were from the prototyping phase.  They worked fine.
